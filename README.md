OARP
----
Package for **O**rdering and **A**lignment of **R**igid **P**ointclouds.

This library provides tools for quickly aligning two rigid point clouds through ICP.

It also provides fast algorithms for reordering pointclouds - adjusting the vertex order of a pointcloud to minimise the per element distance to each vertex in another pointcloud. This may be useful for ordered representations of pointclouds, used in ~~remeshing schemes or graph networks~~
